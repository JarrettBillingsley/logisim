General Logisim Translation Guide - by Ilia Lilov; multiple edits and fixes by Carl Burch

This guide explains how translate Logisim using the OmegaT program, including
the GUI strings (those appearing in menus and dialogs), the documentation, and
the home page. Most of this guide applies to all three targets. When there are
differences, a block marked ===gui=== below means notes unique to the GUI
translation process; similarly, ===doc=== marks notes for documentation, and
===www=== marks notes for the home page.


STEP 1: GETTING THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION

1.1. First, you have to get the English template for translation (the "source"
in other words). The best way is to use trunk of Logisim's Subversion repository:

    https://circuit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/circuit/trunk

If you use Windows, you might try installing and learning the program from
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/. If you use GNU/Linux, you want to make sure
the 'svn' command is installed.

1.2. Make a directory where you will have the working copy of Logisim's SVN
repository. I will refer that directory as "SVN-logisim/" below in this guide.

1.3. If you're not familiar with Subversion (SVN), you will probably want to
read up on it a bit. But basically, you have to know just few commands. If
you're using a command-line SVN installation (particularly for GNU/Linux), then
these commands are listed below; all should be done from SVN-logisim/.

* To get the most recent version:

===gui===
svn co https://circuit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/circuit/trunk/src/resources resources
=========

===www===
svn co https://circuit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/circuit/trunk/www www
=========

===doc===
svn co https://circuit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/circuit/trunk/doc doc
=========

The first run of this command will create a corresponding subdirectory in
SVN-logisim/. I will refer it as "SUBDIR" below.

* To see your changes before you start uploading (not essential, but a good idea):

    svn status SUBDIR

* To upload the files you've produced into the SVN repository:

    svn ci SUBDIR -m "Short description of changes"

  This command will only upload the files that previously existed in the
  repository and that you have changed.

  It's good style to always add a description to let other contributors know the
  purpose of the change. Some of us have subscribed to be notified with each
  message, and we definitely want to read what the update addresses.

* To add new files or folders, use this:

    svn add FILES_TO_ADD
    
  The "add" command (and the "rm" and "mv" commands below) do not actually
  change the central Logisim repository; it changes the local copy, and the
  change is later sent to the central Logisim repository with the next "ci"
  command.
  
  Note that simply adding a file into your SVN-logisim/ directory does not work:
  You must tell SVN explicitly that you actually wish for it to be uploaded.
    
* To remove files or folders, use this:

    svn rm FILES_TO_REMOVE
    
* To rename (move) files or folders, use this:

    svn mv OLD_FILE_NAME NEW_FILE_NAME


1.4. (Alternatively, you could avoid SVN entirely. You'd unpack the latest generic
version (a JAR file - which is essentially a ZIP archive) and get templates from
its subdirectories. This approach is inferior to SVN because (a) you'll be
working from outdated files and (b) it's a lot more convenient to transfer your
finished work into Subversion's file system. If you're sure you want to avoid
Subversion, let us know.

1.5. 
===gui===
As a Java program, Logisim stores translatable strings in Java's .properties
file format ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties ). However, you don't
have to edit those files manually. Note: this file format uses Unicode escape
characters for non-ASCII characters. For example, "ελληνικά" will look like
"\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac". You don't necessarily need
to worry about this if you use OmegaT, though; it handles the format well.
=========


STEP 2: GETTING STARTED WITH OMEGAT 

2.1. I strongly recommend using the OmegaT program (http://omegat.org/) for
the translation process. I know a version called OmegaT+ exists; it has a more
attractive interface, but it is missing some features we need. I prefer to use
OmegaT's beta versions; they are stable enough. After installing it (OmegaT, not
OmegaT+), you'll want to read about it. It includes very good documentation. I
will not post here HOW to use it (read the documentation), but I will post WHAT
exactly you have to do within it.

Anyway, if you have any problems with it, I will help you as much as I can.
With this file there is screenshot (01-omegat-handy-window-layout.png)
illustrating the panel placement that I find the most useful for my work.

2.2 Open OmegaT. Choose Preferences->File Filters menu item. All the checkboxes
have to be checked except for "Text files" one.
===gui===
Select "Java Resource Bundles" item and press "Edit...". Make sure "Translated
files names template" string is "${nameOnly}.${extension}".
=========

===doc===
Select "HTML and XHTML files" item and press "Edit...". Uncheck all the checkboxes:
we needn't translate or change them (see item 2.9.1 of this guide to know why
it's true for images' URLs).
=========

I strongly recommend using a monospace font (menu item Preferences->Font)!
It helps to avoid missing or excess spaces, dots, and commas.

2.3 Create a new project (it is actually just a directory). Name of the project
(and of the directory) should be the next ("de" is an example):

===gui===
omegat-logisim-resources_de
========= 

===doc===
omegat-logisim-doc_de
=========

===www===
omegat-logisim-www_de
=========

We should include standard names for these directories, because they affect
names of some files, which we will upload to trunk/xlate of SVN rep.

The OmegaT project should have the following parameters:
 * Source files language: EN;
 * Target file language: DE-DE (for example). Make sure you've specified
 "sublanguage" after a dash, since the spellchecker requires it to be specified.
 You don't have to type the target language - you can just choose from the
 drop-down list. (Here and below "DE-DE" and "de" is an example; you should
 replace it with your language, of course.)
 
===gui===
 * Source files directory: "SVN-logisim/resources/logisim/en/";
 * Translated files directory: "SVN-logisim/resources/logisim/de/";
========= 

===doc===
 * Source files directory: "SVN-logisim/doc/en/html"; You have to
 create this dir previously. We can't use "SVN-logisim/doc/en/" directly,
 because we have to change something there before feed it to OmegaT.
 * Translated files directory: "SVN-logisim/doc/de/html";
=========

===www===
 * Source files directory: "SVN-logisim/www/en/";
 * Translated files directory: "SVN-logisim/www/de/";
=========
 
Leave other fields with their default values.


2.4 Set up two-directional dictionary (EN <-> DE); it will be very handy. You
have to download it separately.

2.5 Set up spell checking. It is very important! It will help you to avoid many
mistakes. Don't trust yourself! :)

2.6 Set up Machine Translation to Google Translate. It will be incredibly handy!
But don't trust it completely; it's work for human, and the machine is just a
helper.

2.7.
===gui===
Logisim uses libraries written by other people for the dialogs for choosing
fonts and colors. Their setup is different from what Logisim uses, and their
.properties files can be found in resources/bric/ and resources/connectina/.
These directories have unique (and inconvenient) path, so we have to process
them separately. Feel free to invent your own way to translate them
(for example, you could create separate OmegaT project or change source
and target paths for omegat-logisim-resources_de project temporarily).
Once you do it, they will not change for long time. Anyway, you have
to use these files as sources:
    SVN-logisim/resources/bric/ColorPicker.properties
    SVN-logisim/resources/connectina/FontChooserDialog.properties
    SVN-logisim/resources/connectina/JFontChooser.properties
Translate them and create these files:
    SVN-logisim/resources/bric/ColorPicker_de.properties
    SVN-logisim/resources/connectina/FontChooserDialog_de.properties
    SVN-logisim/resources/connectina/JFontChooser_de.properties
"de" is an example again (and in fact, a German translation already exists, so
this step could be skipped for "de").

When you will have them translated, it's courteous to send those files to
the authors of the upstream libraries so they can include it in their work:

ColorPicker: Jeremy Wood, mickleness@gmail.com
JFontChooser: Christos Bohoris, christos.bohoris@connectina.com
=========

2.8. Important: OmegaT considers segments with equal English strings as the same
segment. For example, suppose you enter a translation for "North" once, and then
you find the same word again and edit it to different translation; OmegaT will
change the previous translation too. There is no way to change this behavior yet
(in this version). Sometimes the same English word or phrase can be translated
differently (particularly since English has barely any endings). If you find
such a situation, you have to use a trick: For example, you could use
an intermediate directory as sources for OmegaT project and edit the .properties
file manually there, changing the English version slightly, and reload the
project (F5). For example, I changed "Base" in Vertical alignment section of
std.properties to "Base-" (as well as three other directions).


===doc===
2.9.1. You will probably want to replace (translate) some of the images
and keep others unchanged from the English documentation. All images are placed
into three directories:

 SVN-logisim/doc/en/icons
 SVN-logisim/doc/en/img-guide
 SVN-logisim/doc/en/img-libs
 
If you have no substantive changes to make, then the SVN-logisim/doc/de directory
shouldn't include any subdirectories except html/. If you have any images to
replace English ones, place them in the corresponding subdirectory of
SVN-logisim/doc/de. It's most likely you will not want to replace images from
icons/ and img-libs/ directories. Do not worry about changing the "img" tags
in the HTML: The script used for producing a JAR file for distribution will
identify which images are particular to your translation and which should be
taken from the English version, and it will quietly transform the HTML as it
produces the JAR file with a link to the appropriate image.

(Actually, you may keep unchanged images from English documentation in your
SVN-logisim/doc/de directory. It will help to preview documentation using browser,
but it will make SVN repository a bit harder to interpret.)

Also, don't worry about specifying the "width" and "height" attributes for img
elements. As long as you use PNGs, the script for generating the JAR file will
again insert this into the HTML that gets archived into the JAR file. (In fact,
if you specify a width or height attribute for an img element, the script will
simply overwrite this as it creates the JAR file.)

2.9.2. Return back and translate images wich have to be translated. It's your
decision which ones. If you decide to remake screen shots (so they show the
translated GUI), then it's best if you produce images that don't eat up much
disk space - if the documentation gets too large, then Logisim will have to be
distributed without translations of the documentation included. There are three
different techniques I suggest for this:

* Try to select a windowing theme that is plain (without gradients).

* Try to use windows that aren't much larger than what you are trying to
  illustrate. (This is good for users browsing on smaller monitors anyway.)
  
* Open the PNG file using some graphic editor (for example, GIMP) and change the
  image mode to "indexed 32 colors" without using any dithering. After doing
  this in GIMP, I generally go to the Colormap dialog (under Dockable dialogs),
  click the whitest square, and change it to 'ffffff' so that it is pure white.
  Then I go to do the same thing to change the blackest square to '000000'.

If you want to remake screenshots, you will surely want the circuits used to
create the English screenshots. Those can be found in the directory doc/circs
on Subversion.
=========

STEP 3: DO THE TRANSLATION!

Here are some guidelines I think are useful for doing the translation.

3.1. I suggest making a glossary (not in the program, just in your mind)
  and stick to it all the time. It's very, very important. Otherwise,
  users will be confused. If you will decide to translate documentation,
  you will have to follow the same glossary there too. I have
  made a list "what have to be in a glossary":

	input, output, circuit, subcircuit, supercircuit,
	component, pin, splitter, combined end and split ends (for a splitter),
	attribute, facing, data bits, rising edge, falling edge, select bits,
	seed (for Random), stage (for Shift Register),
	circuit's layout, appearance, port,
	project, library, main circuit,
	gate, shaped (gates), rectangular (gates),
	poke, poking, mouse mapping,
	wire, wire bundle, width,
	simulate, simulation, oscillation, tick, state (of simulation),
	log, logging, 
	canvas, tutorial, template, option and parameter (for command line)

  Of course, any word that can be found two and more times with the same sense
  have to be translated equally. But the list above identifies words and phrases
  that have many different common meanings, but within Logisim they are exact
  terms, and you have to decide which word/phrase in your language fits better.

3.2. Give particular attention to names of components and their
  attributes for the built-in libraries! Almost all of them have exact
  corresponding term in your language; you should to find them if you
  don't know them. One of the possible ways to find right translations:
  open http://en.wikipedia.org , find English article about a component,
  then switch to version of that page in your language (if it exists).

  (Remember: "Splitter" isn't a standard term; it is invented by Carl
  (so, it is in the glossary list).)


3.3. Carl left us a freedom to translate words (and even letters) inside
  some components on the canvas (like RAM or Bit Extender). But my
  decision was to leave them untranslated following the simple policy:
  "everything what can get to foreigner (names of circuits or those
  words inside components on canvas on screen shots) has to be in
  English". For example, if you translate the "D" letter inside a D flip-flop as
  a Δ; then a screenshot of the circuit would be difficult to understand for
  somebody who does not know Greek. Of course, you can sway from this policy.

3.4. When everything seems to be done, read and check all the phrases: any of
  your mistakes will be visible by hundreds - probably thousands - of people!


STEP 4: PRODUCING RESULTING FILES

4.1. Generate translation (press Ctrl+D within OmegaT) and commit it to
SVN. Item 1.3 of this guide briefly describes how to do that. If you don't
use SVN, just archive it in a ZIP or TGZ file and send it to Carl or to me.


STEP 5: KEEPING UP WITH NEW VERSIONS

If you have started and uploaded the translation once, then you of course
know how to do it one more time. Anyway, let me remind you what you
should to do if some "source" is changed:

5.1. While in your SVN directory, retrieve the new files; item 1.3 of this
guide briefly describes how to do that.

5.2. If you do some tricks (item 2.8 of this guide describes them),
then don't forget to repeat them for new sources (of course in your
intermediate directory).

5.3. Reload OmegaT project (F5). Don't worry about losing anything! OmegaT
stores your translations for all the strings in the memory, even for strings
which had gone from the source files. You will never lose your work using
OmegaT. Finally, you may make a backup of the project dir if you're worrying.

5.4. Translate new strings. (Press Ctrl+U to locate them.)

5.5. Generate result (target) files (Ctrl+D). They are already in your
SVN-logisim dir, so now you may commit to SVN. However, you're advised to run
'svn status' first to ascertain what you'll change when you commit to SVN.


STEP 6: SHARING YOUR OMEGAT PROJECT

6.1. It's nice to set things up so you could conceivably share the translation
process, since the documentation is large. Also it will be important to your
work's continued usefulness even if you decide to stop maintaining of the
translation - a later translator can continue with your work.

One of the ways to do that is to use SVN to upload OmegaT project files.
Actually, there are only 5 files in every OmegaT project that are useful for
archiving:

omegat-logisim-TARGET-level1.tmx
omegat-logisim-TARGET-level2.tmx
omegat-logisim-TARGET-omegat.tmx
omegat/learned_words.txt
omegat/project_save.tmx

(TARGET may mean "resources_de", "doc_de", or "www_de", where "de" means your
language.)

I think it's bad idea to merge for example SVN-logisim/xlate/de/doc
local directory and omegat-logisim-doc_de local directory. It may cause confusion.
Also, I think it's bad idea to update trunk/xlate every time if you work on the
translation alone: *.tmx files are very large and it will take long time. It makes
sense to update trunk/xlate one time per 3-5 days or before long period without
changes. So, my idea is to copy those 5 files manually to SVN-logisim/xlate/de/doc
every time before committing. If you use GNU/Linux, it's much easier: you could
write simple bash script or use symlinks.
To ensure you have right file structure in your trunk/xlate/ folder,
look at the Russian one (I hope I'll keep it correct and clear):
http://circuit.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/circuit/trunk/xlate/ru/doc/
