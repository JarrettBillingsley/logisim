<h1>Getting Logisim</h1>

<p>Logisim should run on any platform supporting Java,
version 5 or later.</p>

<ol>

<li>Logisim requires Java 5 or later. If you do not already
have it on your computer, Java is available from <tt><a
href=http://java.sun.com>java.sun.com</a></tt>.</p></li>

<li>Download Logisim from <a
href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/>Logisim's SourceForge.net
page</a>. You will three choices of which release to download.
<ul>
<li>A <tt>.jar</tt> file - runs on any platform, though
not necessarily conveniently.
<li>A MacOS <tt>.tar.gz</tt> file
<li>A Windows <tt>.exe</tt> file
</ul>
If you use MacOS or Windows, I would recommend using the
release specific to your platform.</p></li>

<li>To execute the program:
<ul>

<li><em>With the generic <tt>.jar</tt> file:</em> On Windows and MacOS
systems, you will likely be able to start Logisim by double-clicking
the JAR file. If that doesn't work, or if you use Linux or Solaris,
you can type ``<tt>java -jar logisim-<em>XX</em>.jar</tt>'' at the
command line.</p></li>

<li><em>With the MacOS X version:</em> Once the downloaded
<tt>.tar.gz</tt> version is uncompressed (this will likely happen
automatically), just double-click the Logisim icon to start.  You may
want to place the icon into the Applications folder.</p></li>

<li><em>With the Windows version:</em> Just double-click the
Logisim icon.  You may want to create a shortcut on the desktop
and/or in the Start menu to make starting Logisim
easier.</p></li>

</ul></li>

</ol>
