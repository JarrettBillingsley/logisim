<h3><a name="pronounce">How do you pronounce Logisim?</a></h3>

<p>LODJ-uh-sim. I've heard people pronounce it LOG-ism, and that's just
wrong.</p>

<h3><a name="source">Can I get a copy of the source code?</a></h3>

<p>The source code is available under the <a href=gpl.html>GNU Public
License</a>, and it is included in the distributed JAR file
within the <code>src</code> subdirectory.</p>

<h3><a name="publish">Can I place a copy of the JAR file on a Web page
for my students to download?</a></h3>

<p>First: Please let me know that you are using the program for your
class. The more schools that contact me about using Logisim, the easier
it will be for me to get support at my college to continue developing
it. <a href=usage.html>Schools using Logisim</a>.</p>

<p>But to answer your question: That would absolutely be OK per
the terms of Logisim's license (the <a href="gpl.html">GNU
Public License</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="textbook">I'd like to include your software with a
textbook I'm publishing. Is that OK?</a></h3>

<p>Of course; that usage would fall within the <a href="gpl.html">GPL</a>,
so technically you don't have to ask. But if it's a
textbook that is used widely, I encourage you to contact me to discuss
how Logisim can be altered to complement the textbook better.</p>

<h3><a name="sluggish">Why is Logisim so darn slow?</a></h3>

<p>Actually, even though I use a low-power computer with a rather slow
processor, I haven't noticed problems with Logisim's speed.
(I would admit that startup is a bit sluggish, though.)</p>

<p>To the extent that Logisim is sluggish, you may be inclined to
blame the Java environment; but you'd be wrong. Inasmuch as it is
slow, it is because I lack the time or incentive to make it fast.
There are all sorts of places where the program does horribly efficient
things, like repainting the whole circuit every time you move the
mouse, or allocating memory in many more situations than necessary.
I haven't noticed that this inefficiency causes speed problems, and
so I've concentrated on adding features instead of worrying over what
appears to be a non-problem.</p>

<h3><a name="gripe">Add feature <em>X</em> now!</a></h3>

<p>Ok, first of all, this is a <b>Q</em>&amp;A</b> page, and that's not a
question or an answer.</p>

<p>Please remember that you aren't paying for Logisim. If you'd like to
pay me at reasonable rates, I'll be happy to entertain demands. In the
meantime, please reciprocate my generosity in releasing the program
by politely wording suggestions for improvements.  And thanks for
the suggestion!</p>
