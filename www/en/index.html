<p>Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital
logic circuits. With its simple toolbar interface and simulation of
circuits as you build them, it is simple enough to facilitate learning
the most basic concepts related to logic circuits.  With the capacity
to build larger circuits from smaller subcircuits, and to draw bundles
of wires with a single mouse drag, Logisim can be used (and is used)
to design and simulate entire CPUs for educational purposes.</p>

<p>Logisim is used by students at <a href="../usage.html">colleges and
universities around the world</a> in many types of classes, ranging
from a brief unit on logic in general-education computer science
surveys, to computer organization courses, to full-semester courses on
computer architecture.</p>

<p>Logisim is free software, released under the terms of the
<a href="../gpl.html">GNU General Public License, version 2</a>.</p>
