<h1>User comments</h1>

<p>If you find Logisim useful, please let me know!  <em>Especially</em>
do this if you use Logisim in a class you teach! E-mail me at the
address given below.</p>

<p>Bug reports, feature requests, and questions are most welcome at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/">Logisim's page at
SourceForge.net</a>.  You can also e-mail me &mdash; though that bears more
risk of becoming lost.</p>

<p>In any e-mail, please write in English (even if it's broken English!),
and please include a descriptive subject
line so that your message doesn't get lost among the junk mail.</p>

<p>Affirmative comments will help me get support to develop the program
further, and helpful comments will point out what is most important for
future versions. I value all e-mail received about Logisim, as I want
it to become as useful an educational tool as possible.</p>
