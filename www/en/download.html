<h1>Getting Logisim</h1>

<p>Logisim is free software, released under the terms of the
<a href="../gpl.html">GNU General Public License, version 2</a>.
It should run on any platform supporting Java,
version 5 or later.</p>

<ol>

<li>Logisim requires Java 5 or later. If you do not already
have it on your computer, Java is available from <tt><a
href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a></tt>.</p></li>

<li><p>Download Logisim from <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/">Logisim's SourceForge.net
page</a>. You have three choices of which release to download.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <tt>.jar</tt> file - this should run on any platform, though
not necessarily conveniently.
<li>A <tt>.tar.gz</tt> file for MacOS X
<li>A <tt>.exe</tt> file for Windows
</ul>
<p>If you use MacOS X or Windows, the
release specific to your platform will work best.</p></li>

<li><p>To execute the program:</p>
<ul>

<li><p><em>With the generic <tt>.jar</tt> file:</em>
On many platforms, you can start the JAR file by double-clicking
its icon. If that doesn't work, find your platform's command line and enter:</p>

<blockquote><tt>java&nbsp;-jar&nbsp;logisim-generic-<em>XX</em>.jar</tt></blockquote></li>

<li><p><em>With the MacOS X version:</em> First uncompressed the downloaded
<tt>.tar.gz</tt> file: This might happen
automatically, or you might have to double-click it.
Then just double-click the Logisim icon to start.  You may
want to move the icon into the Applications folder.</p></li>

<li><p><em>With the Windows version:</em> Logisim does not have an install process;
the executable file is truly the file that you want to execute.
Just double-click the Logisim icon.  You may want to create a shortcut on the
desktop and/or in the Start menu to make starting Logisim easier.</p></li>

</ul></li>

<li><p>The standard release of Logisim includes an English translation
(written by TRANSLATOR NAME of TRANSLATOR INSTITUTION).
To use the English translation:</p>

<ol>

<li>After starting Logisim, go to the File menu and select Preferences...
(On a Macintosh, this will be in the Logisim menu.)</li>

<li>At the top of the Preferences window, select the International tab.</li>

<li>From the dropdown menu labeled Language, select English language.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>
