Things I've changed:

- Tunnels will appear "ghosted" if they have no partners (unconnected to anything)
- Tunnels can now be color-coded
- No more asynchronous 0 clear on registers
- Plexers now default to NOT having an enable input
- Gates now default to narrow with 2 inputs
- On mac, program now exits when closing last window
- On mac, program now confirms save on exit, as Logisim was using an old method of detecting that which breaks on newer versions of macOS/Java.
